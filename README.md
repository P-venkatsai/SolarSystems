# Solar System Animation

Welcome to the Solar System Animation project! This repository showcases a sample solar system created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript animations. Through this project, I had a lot of fun and also gained valuable insights into how animations work with JavaScript, as well as improved my familiarity with the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Features

- **Solar System Animation:** The project includes an animated representation of a solar system. Using JavaScript, the planets orbit around the sun, providing a visual simulation of a real solar system.
